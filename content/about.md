I'm a full stack software developer. I graduated from the University of Louisville with a degree in Computer Information Systems with concentrations in Web Development and Information Security. I currently volunteer as a mentor for Code Louisville, a program that teaches students about the wonderful world of programming and how it all works. I have a passion for building websites that not only look nice, but serve a purpose. I want to solve a problem with the work I do.
